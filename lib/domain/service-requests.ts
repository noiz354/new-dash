/**
 * Service-request triage state machine (Phase 1 slice 2).
 * Statuses match the DB check constraint `sr_status_ck`:
 * OPEN / TRIAGED / CONVERTED / CLOSED / BREACHED.
 *
 * CONVERTED and CLOSED are terminal: a converted ticket lives on as its work
 * order (convertedWoNumber), and conversion is ONE-WAY/one-time — the second
 * convert attempt hits the optimistic guard as SR_INVALID_TRANSITION (409).
 * BREACHED is a (seeded/overdue) non-terminal state: triage/convert/close
 * are all allowed so staff can recover late tickets.
